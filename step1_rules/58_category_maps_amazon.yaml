        item_title_regex: '(?i)\b(thermal\s+(receipt\s+)?paper|receipt\s+paper|pos\s+(paper|roll|tape)|register\s+(tape|paper)|receipt\s+rolls?)\b'
      map_to_l2: C61  # POS Paper & Register Supplies
      priority: 150
      notes: POS supplies like MUNBYN thermal receipt paper map to POS Paper (override UNSPSC paper)
    
    # Specific: Barcode/UPC label rolls (Zebra/Rollo compatible) → Labels & Stickers
    - match:
        item_title_regex: '(?i)\\b(label|labels|barcode|upc|zebra|rollo)\\b|(?i)\\b(UPC|barcode)[^\n]{0,80}?labels?\\b'
      map_to_l2: C23

      map_to_l2: C32
      priority: 120
      notes: Equipment filters like 3M HF20-S

    # Backup: Retail snacks by brand/keywords (low priority)

    # ===== FEES (Amazon-specific) =====
    
    - match:
        is_fee: true
        text_contains: ['shipping', 'freight']
      map_to_l2: C80  # Shipping/Delivery
      priority: 100

      priority: 95
      notes: Other fees
    
    
    
    

notes:
  - Rules are evaluated in priority order (highest first)
  - item_title_regex matches against product Title (case-insensitive)
  - text_contains is for fee items (product_name field)
  - category matches against Amazon-Internal Product Category
  - group and seller can be used for additional filtering
  - is_fee=true applies only to fee items (not products)
  - If no rule matches, item falls through to keyword/heuristic matching
